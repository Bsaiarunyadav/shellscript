# i want to add any two nummber instead of add number inside the file .

# This is the comment , we need to develop a program that can do addition of 2 number 

# so firstly i will create a variable as 

NUMBER1=$1
NUMBER2=$2

# I need to run this command inside the shell to add 2 number now 
#COMMAND
SUM=$((NUMBER1+NUMBER2)) 
# Rember this is an arthematic equation.
#By running the command it will not show the result as we not printed any thing so

echo "Additon of 2 number is: $sum"
